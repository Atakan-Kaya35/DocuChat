# Increase max line length to 200 (more practical for modern screens)
max-line-length = 200

# Ignore specific rules that are too strict for this project:
# W293: blank line contains whitespace
# W291: trailing whitespace  
# W292: no newline at end of file
# W391: blank line at end of file
# W503: line break before binary operator (conflicts with PEP 8)
# E501: line too long (handled by max-line-length increase)
# E127/E128: continuation line indentation (stylistic preference)
# E226: missing whitespace around arithmetic operator
# E306: expected blank line before nested definition
# E402: module level import not at top (Django pattern)
# E704: multiple statements on one line (used in tests)
# F401: imported but unused (often needed for re-exports)
# F541: f-string missing placeholders (sometimes intentional)
# F841: local variable assigned but never used
