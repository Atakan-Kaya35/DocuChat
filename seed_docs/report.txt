# Incident Report (2026-01-16)

Summary:
- Users reported citations opening the wrong chunk after reindex.
- Root cause suspected: chunk_index stability changed due to updated chunking rules.
- Another suspected issue: reindex did not delete old doc_chunks; unique constraint prevented overwrite, leaving stale vectors.

Timeline:
- 10:05 - new chunking deployed (char window increased)
- 10:20 - reindex performed using v1 runbook
- 10:35 - first report of mismatch citations

Actions taken:
- Reverted chunking change
- Drafted v2 runbook requiring doc_chunks deletion on reindex
- Added note: embedding model change requires full reindex
