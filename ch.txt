# Change Request (2026-01-15)

Requested changes:
1. Lower rate limits to reduce CPU spikes:
   - upload: 3 per 10 minutes per user
   - ask: 20 per 10 minutes per user
2. Retries should be tightened:
   - embeddings: 2 attempts max
   - generation: 1 retry max
3. Reindex must delete old chunks to avoid mixed-embedding state.
4. Deletion must be full cleanup: chunks, jobs, file, document row.

Rationale:
- Observed duplicated chunks after reindex.
- Observed latency spikes during mass uploads.
